# Build Stage
#
# This stage installs all dependencies (including dev), builds the TypeScript
# source code into JavaScript, and prepares the production assets.
#
# Pinned to BUILDPLATFORM, not the target platform. `bun run build` emits
# platform-independent JavaScript and only `dist/` is copied forward, so this
# stage has no reason to run under emulation — and under QEMU it does not run
# at all: Bun's JavaScriptCore aborts with a spurious MemoryExhaustion
# assertion (~21 MB peak), so a cross-arch build of this stage fails outright
# on an arm64 host. Building natively also removes emulation from the slowest
# stage of a multi-arch build.
