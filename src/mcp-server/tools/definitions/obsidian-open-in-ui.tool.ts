/**
 * @fileoverview obsidian_open_in_ui — open a file in the Obsidian app UI.
 * Defaults to `failIfMissing: true` because Obsidian silently creates files on
 * open otherwise; opt out for an "open or create" flow.
 *
 * The existence probe runs on both paths. It is what lets `createdIfMissing`
 * report what actually happened, and it is the point where an open that would
 * create a file is gated as a write — so opening a note that already exists
 * keeps working under `OBSIDIAN_READ_ONLY`, while the create-capable branch is
 * refused there and outside `OBSIDIAN_WRITE_PATHS`.
