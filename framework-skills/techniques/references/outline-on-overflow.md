# Outline-on-overflow

Return a section **outline** when a single document-shaped payload is too big to inline, and let the agent re-call the same tool for only the sections it needs. The honest alternative to truncation for the *one fat document* case.

Ships as `outlineOnOverflow` + friends in `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/utils`.

## The problem

Some tools fetch one large **document-shaped** record. An FDA drug label is a single ~130KB / ~32K-token payload dominated by raw HTML sections. Returning it whole burns the agent's context; truncating it either hides data or — when only `format()` is trimmed — silently desyncs `content[]` from `structuredContent`. Neither is acceptable.

This is distinct from the other two overflow shapes:

| Shape | Technique |
|:--|:--|
| Many rows (tabular) | `spillover()` → DataCanvas SQL handle (see `api-canvas`) |
| Capped list | honest truncation disclosure |
| **One large document** | **outline-on-overflow (this file)** |

## Philosophy

**Never truncate to fit a budget.** When a payload is too big, return a complete, honest outline of what's available plus how to retrieve it — identically on `content[]` and `structuredContent`.

## The shape — a flat `output` with a `kind` discriminator

The outline is the payload the agent acts on, so it lands in the **main body** (`structuredContent` + `content[]`), as a variant of the tool's own `output`. Not the enrichment block — enrichment is *additive* (`output.extend(...)` merged after `output.parse(result)`), so it can add fields to the fat document but never replace it. Not a post-hoc framework swap either — that would emit a `structuredContent` shape the advertised `outputSchema` (`tools/list`) doesn't describe. A single `output` object carrying both modes — a `kind` discriminator plus presence-based optional arms — is the placement that replaces the payload, is advertised honestly, and holds `format()`-parity. (`tool()` requires `output` to be a `ZodObject`: the `schema-is-object` lint rule and the enrichment `.extend()` are both object-only, so a `z.discriminatedUnion` output is rejected — model the two modes as optional arms of one object, not union branches.)

```ts
import { tool, z } from '@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core';
import {
  OUTLINE_VARIANT,
  outlineOnOverflow,
  selectSections,
  formatOutline,
} from '@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/utils';

const FullLabel = z.object({ /* every section field */ });

export const getLabel = tool('get_label', {
  description: 'Fetch a drug label. Returns the full record, or a section outline when it overflows.',
  input: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe('Label query'),
    sections: z
      .array(z.string())
      .optional()
      .describe('Sections to return. Omit for the full label (or an outline if it overflows).'),
  }),
  output: z.object({
    kind: z.enum(['full', 'outline']),
    ...FullLabel.partial().shape,                         // full arm — every field optional
    sections: OUTLINE_VARIANT.shape.sections.optional(),  // outline arm
    notice: OUTLINE_VARIANT.shape.notice.optional(),
  }),
  // Render each arm on field presence, independently — never branch on `kind` (see below).
  format: (r) => [
    ...(r.id ? renderLabel(r) : []),  // full arm — key on a full-only field
    ...(r.sections ? formatOutline({ kind: 'outline', sections: r.sections, notice: r.notice ?? '' }) : []),
  ],
  async handler(input) {
    const doc = await fetchLabel(input.query); // deterministic from query
    if (input.sections?.length) {
      // selection path — slice to requested keys plus always-kept metadata
      return { ...selectSections(doc, input.sections, { alwaysKeep: ['id', 'set_id'] }), kind: 'full' as const };
    }
    return outlineOnOverflow(doc, { budget: 24_000 }); // disclosure path → full | outline
  },
});
```

`format()`-parity holds because every terminal field in `output` must appear in the rendered text. With a flat object the linter builds **one** synthetic sample with every optional field populated at once, so render each arm on field presence, independently — a mutually-exclusive `if (kind === 'outline') … else …` renders only one arm against that all-fields sample and fails parity for the other. `formatOutline` is the shipped renderer for the `outline` arm; you supply the `full` renderer. That keeps the two client surfaces in lockstep.

## The helper

`@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/utils` ships the whole pattern — pure measurement + key-slicing, no DuckDB, so it runs on stdio / HTTP / Workers alike:

| Export | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| `outlineOnOverflow(doc, options?)` | Returns `{ kind: 'full', ...doc }` under budget (or with `< 2` sections), else `{ kind: 'outline', sections, notice }`. |
| `OUTLINE_VARIANT` | The reusable `outline`-arm Zod schema; fold `.shape.sections` / `.shape.notice` into your flat `output` object as optional arms. |
| `selectSections(doc, want, { alwaysKeep })` | Projects the document to requested keys plus always-kept metadata. The selection-path counterpart. |
| `formatOutline(outline)` | Renders the outline to `content[]` for `format()`. |
| `DEFAULT_OUTLINE_BUDGET_BYTES` | The default budget (`24_000`) when `options.budget` is omitted. |

`outlineOnOverflow` options:

- `budget` — serialized-byte threshold (default `DEFAULT_OUTLINE_BUDGET_BYTES`). A helper argument, **not** an env var: a deploy-tunable threshold would drift a tool's output *shape* across environments.
- `extract` — custom section extractor. Default: one section per top-level key, sized by `JSON.stringify(value).length`. Override only when "section" means something other than a top-level key.
- `notice` — custom re-call notice builder, called as `(sections, budget)`. The default's worked example names the **largest section that fits the budget**, with its byte size inline; when no single section fits it says so and points at narrowing the request instead of naming a section. Naming the largest sections would hand the agent the most expensive retrieval available — the one most likely to blow the same budget the outline exists to enforce.

The flow:

1. **Measure** the serialized payload (`JSON.stringify(doc).length`).
2. **Under budget** → `{ kind: 'full', ...doc }`.
3. **Over budget, ≥ 2 sections** → the outline (sections sorted largest-first). The agent re-calls with `sections: [...]`.
4. **Over budget, < 2 sections** → `full` anyway (nothing to pick between). A single section that *alone* exceeds budget is a known limitation — sub-section outlining is out of scope.

The budget bounds the **disclosure**, not the selection. `selectSections` returns whatever the agent named, so a selection over several sections — or one section larger than the budget — comes back whole. That is deliberate: the agent asked for those sections by name, and truncating the answer is the thing this technique exists to avoid. The default notice reports each example's size so the selection can be sized before it is made.

## Re-retrieval — why the selection call is stateless

The re-call is **self-contained**, so nothing is stored between the outline call and the selection call:

- The selection call sends the **same input** as the outline call, plus `sections: [...]`.
- The handler **re-fetches** the document — input-minus-`sections` is identical and the upstream query is deterministic, so it reproduces the exact same record — then applies `selectSections` (a pure projection: requested keys + `alwaysKeep` metadata).
- You **reconstruct rather than remember**. The agent holds the continuity (it passes `sections`); the upstream holds the document.

The only cost is the redundant fetch. For a **rate-limited or expensive upstream**, trade it for an optional cache:

```ts
const key = `label:${input.query}`;                          // NOTE: excludes `sections`
let doc = await ctx.state.get<Label>(key).catch(() => null); // best-effort read
if (!doc) {
  doc = await fetchLabel(input.query);
  await ctx.state.set(key, doc, { ttl: 300 }).catch(() => {}); // best-effort write, 5 min
}
```

- **Key excludes the `sections` selector** — otherwise the outline call and the selection call compute different keys and never share the doc.
- **Best-effort** — a miss or a read/write failure falls through to the stateless refetch, so correctness never depends on the cache.
- Rides `ctx.state` (the tenant-scoped KV abstraction), which is **independent of `MCP_SESSION_MODE`**. It does *not* require switching the server to stateful sessions and has no end-user-visible effect (a miss behaves exactly like the stateless path). Tenant-scoping isolates per-identity under `jwt`/`oauth`; the shared `default` tenant (stdio, HTTP + `none`) is benign because the cached value is a deterministic public-query → document map, not user state. If the upstream itself returns identity-scoped data, fold the auth principal into the key.

The framework ships no cache-key helper — the pattern above is one line and tool-specific (which fields key the doc, what TTL). **Default to stateless.** Reach for the cache only where the upstream cost is real.

## When to use

- A single tool result is one **document-shaped** record that can exceed a context-meaningful size.
- The record has addressable parts (top-level sections) the agent can choose among.

## When not to

- **Many rows** → `spillover()`. The document here is one row; spilling rows leaves the per-record size intact.
- **A capped list** → truncation disclosure.
- **No meaningful sub-structure** to outline → there's nothing to pick. Return it, or shrink it at the source (drop redundant fields before measuring).
