# README.md Conventions for MCP Servers

Structure and content guide for creating or updating a README for an MCP server built on `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core`. If a README already exists, use this as a reference to audit and improve it — don't blindly rewrite sections that are already accurate.

The reference implementation is the `pubmed-mcp-server` README — https://github.com/cyanheads/pubmed-mcp-server/blob/main/README.md. Read it in full before writing, mirror its structure, reuse its non-server-specific content, and treat it as authoritative wherever this file lags behind it.

## Concision

A README is read once by a human deciding whether and how to use the server. It is not the changelog, not the schema, and not a proof that a feature works. Apply these on every pass, including re-runs over a README that is already accurate — accuracy is the floor, not the finish.

**Keep, always:** canonical identifiers (tool, resource, prompt, field, env var, and enum names, exactly as the code spells them); per-call caps and limits; input alternatives and which are required; the fields a caller branches on (discriminators, typed reasons, status values); feature flags and the env var that controls each; anything a caller must know before the first call. Brevity never earns semantic loss — if cutting a clause drops a fact from this list, the clause stays.

**Cut:** narration of how a guarantee is implemented ("so a value stays under the header it belongs to"); restated `.describe()` semantics — the schema carries them at call time; edge-case walkthroughs; the distinction between two similar values when the names already carry it; release-note accretion (a bullet that exists because a version added it, not because a reader needs it); marketing adjectives; a heading's intro sentence that repeats its Overview row.

**The test, per bullet:** would a reader lose a fact they need before their first call? If not, cut or merge. If a bullet needs more than two sentences, it is describing mechanism — keep the contract, drop the mechanism.

**Validate what stays.** Condensing is where wrong facts creep in — a merged bullet can silently combine two tools' limits or promote a default to a rule. Every identifier, cap, enum value, and default that survives the pass is checked against the definition file before the run ends. Never condense from memory of what the tool does; condense from the schema.

## Structure

Use this section order. Omit sections that don't apply (e.g., skip Docker/Workers if the server doesn't deploy there).

```text
# {Server Name}                         ← centered HTML block (h1 + tagline + surface count)
Info badges                             ← one centered row — Version, License, Docker, MCP SDK, npm, TypeScript, Bun
Install badges                          ← one centered row — Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code
Framework badge                         ← solo spotlight row — `Built on @cyanheads/mcp-ts-core` (cyan-300 #67E8F9)
[Public hosted callout if present]      ← centered HTML block, directly under the Framework badge
---
## Overview                             ← short description paragraph → `### Tools` / `### Resources` / `### Prompts` two-column tables
## Capability reference                 ← one `###` entry per primitive, heading tagged `<sub>tool|resource|prompt</sub>`, contract-shaped bullets
## Features                             ← one-sentence framework line + domain-specific bullets + agent-friendly output bullets

```

## Section Guide

### Title Block

Centered HTML. The `<h1>` is the server name — use the scoped package name if published under a scope (e.g., `@cyanheads/my-mcp-server`). The `<p>` is a bold **action-first** one-liner: lead with what the server _does_, not what it _is_. List the headline actions/workflows, then end with `via MCP. STDIO or Streamable HTTP.` (or whichever transports apply). Avoid `MCP server for/that …` framings — they describe the wrapper instead of the capability. **Nest the surface count as a `<div>` inside the same `<p>`**, separated by `•` (U+2022 bullet) — not as a second `<p>`. This matches the shipping convention across `@cyanheads/*` servers.

```html
<div align="center">
  <h1>@cyanheads/my-mcp-server</h1>
  <p><b>Search projects, manage tasks, track teams via MCP. STDIO or Streamable HTTP.</b>
  <div>7 Tools • 2 Resources • 1 Prompt</div>
  </p>
</div>

<div align="center">

</div>
```

Generate the `<BASE64_CONFIG>` (Cursor) and `<URLENCODED_JSON>` (VS Code) payloads — replace `<PACKAGE_NAME>` / `<SHORT_NAME>` and add `env` only for required API keys:

```bash
# Cursor: base64-encoded JSON. Split command/args, add env when keys are needed.
echo -n '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","<PACKAGE_NAME>"],"env":{"API_KEY":"your-api-key"}}' | base64
# Without env (no required keys):
echo -n '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","<PACKAGE_NAME>"]}' | base64

# VS Code: URL-encoded JSON. Same shape plus a `name` field.
node -p 'encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({name:"<SHORT_NAME>",command:"npx",args:["-y","<PACKAGE_NAME>"],env:{API_KEY:"your-api-key"}}))'
# Without env:
node -p 'encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({name:"<SHORT_NAME>",command:"npx",args:["-y","<PACKAGE_NAME>"]}))'
```

Both clients use the same `{command, args, env}` shape; VS Code adds a top-level `name`. Omit `env` entirely when no API keys are needed — don't include empty objects or framework-only vars like `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE`. Install links route through HTTPS endpoints (`cursor.com/en/install-mcp`, `vscode.dev/redirect`) because GitHub-rendered markdown strips non-HTTP schemes — a raw `cursor://` or `vscode:` link won't click through. Omit any install badge whose target doesn't apply (e.g. no `.mcpb` bundle → drop the Claude Desktop badge).

The header tagline must match the `package.json` `description`.

**Badge selection:** All info badges use `style=flat-square`; install badges use `style=for-the-badge`. Include what applies — don't add badges for things the server doesn't have:

| Badge | Row | When to include |
|:------|:----|:----------------|
| Version | info | Always — link to `CHANGELOG.md` |
| License | info | Always |
| Docker | info | Published to ghcr.io or Docker Hub |
| MCP SDK | info | Always — show the `@modelcontextprotocol/server` version |
| npm | info | Published to npm |
| TypeScript | info | Always |
| Bun | info | If using Bun (standard for this framework) |
| MCP Spec | info | Optional — rarely included; the SDK badge usually suffices |
| Status | info | Optional — Stable, Beta, etc. |
| Code Coverage | info | If coverage is tracked |
| Install in Claude Desktop | install | Repo publishes an `.mcpb` bundle on GitHub Releases (orange `D97757`, anthropic logo) |
| Install in Cursor | install | Published to npm — uses the official `cursor://` deep link |
| Install in VS Code | install | Published to npm — uses the official `vscode:mcp/install` deep link |
| Framework | spotlight | Always — links to `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core` on npm. Cyan-300 (`67E8F9`) for dark text. **Solo on its own row.** |

**Layout:** three centered `<div>` blocks in a fixed order. (1) **Info row** — one line with all info badges in the order above (release/license/distribution first, then SDK/ecosystem/language). (2) **Install + spotlight block** — install badges on one line, then a blank line, then the Framework badge alone on its own line as the brand link back to the framework. (3) **Public hosted callout** if applicable (see next section). Add a `---` horizontal rule after the whole header block.

Omit a whole row when nothing in it applies — e.g. a server with no `.mcpb` bundle and not on npm has no install row at all, so the install + spotlight block collapses to just the Framework badge.

### Public Hosted Callout (if present)

If a public hosted instance is available, **promote it to a top-level callout** in its own centered `<div>` immediately below the Framework badge — don't bury it inside Getting Started. This is the highest-value piece of information for a visitor who wants to try the server with zero install.

```html
<div align="center">

**Public Hosted Server:** [https://my-server.example.com/mcp](https://my-server.example.com/mcp)

</div>
```

Keep the full connection-config JSON block inside a `### Public Hosted Instance` subsection under Getting Started (covered below). This callout is just the visibility pointer.

No hosted instance → omit the callout, the Getting Started subsection, and any hosted mention in the Overview. Never state the absence ("no public hosted instance"); self-hosting is the default a reader already assumes.

### Overview

The first section after the header rule. Two parts: a short description paragraph, then one two-column table per primitive type. This is what a visitor reads to decide whether the server is for them, so it must scan in one screen.

**Description paragraph:** two or three sentences — what the server sits on top of (the upstream APIs), what a user can do with it (the headline workflows, action verbs), and how it runs (transports, plus the hosted endpoint when one exists). Not a count.

The opening sentence names the subject, not the container. The reader is already on an MCP server's repo page — the `<h1>`, the badge row, and the framework line all say so — so an opener that restates it ("An MCP server over…", "An MCP calculator…", "An MCP server that…") spends the most-read sentence on nothing. Lead with the domain or the upstream as a noun phrase, article optional: "Calculator powered by math.js.", "Seismic data from USGS ComCat and the EMSC SeismicPortal.", "The Acme v2 API — projects, tasks, and team activity.", "Read, write, and search Obsidian vault notes over the Local REST API plugin." The words "MCP server" appear at most once in the paragraph, and never as its first noun.

**Primitive tables:** a `### Tools` table, then `### Resources` and `### Prompts` tables when the server has any. Omit a heading whose table would be empty, but keep a one-row table rather than folding it into another. Two columns, Name/Description, one-line descriptions — the detail lives in the Capability reference.

```markdown
## Overview

Project management over the Acme v2 API. Search projects, manage tasks, and track team activity from any MCP client. Runs as a stdio process, a local Streamable HTTP server, or the public hosted endpoint above.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `acme_search_projects` | Search projects by name, status, or team, with pagination and field selection |
| `acme_get_task` | Fetch one or more tasks by ID, with full or summary data |

### Resources

| Resource | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `acme://projects/{projectId}` | Project details by ID |

### Prompts

| Prompt | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `project_summary` | Summarize a project's status and open tasks |
```

Derive every row from the actual definitions — real names and descriptions from the Zod schemas.

If resource data is also reachable through tools, say so in one line under the Resources table; many MCP clients are tool-only and never surface resources. If a prompt has a design doc, link it in one line under the Prompts table.

### Capability reference

One `###` entry per primitive — every tool, resource, and prompt, in the same order as the Overview tables — with the heading tagged by type in a `<sub>` so a reader scanning headings can tell them apart without a section break. Entries are separated by `---` rules. No intro sentence under the heading — the Overview row already said what it does — go straight to bullets.

**Bullet density is contract shape, not changelog narration.** Three to six bullets covering: accepted inputs and per-call caps; the output's discriminating fields; the failure shape (typed reasons, per-item status); the knobs (filters, budgets, feature flags). Behavior a caller discovers from the schema at call time — field-by-field semantics, edge-case handling, the mechanism behind a guarantee — belongs in the definition's `.describe()` text, not here. An entry running past six bullets has started transcribing release notes.

```markdown
## Capability reference

### `acme_search_projects` <sub>tool</sub>

- Free-text query plus typed `status` / `phase` filters; up to 100 per page, offset pagination
- Optional `fields` selection to trim the response
- Results carry `source` and `fetchedAt` so callers can reason about freshness

---

### `acme_get_task` <sub>tool</sub>

- Up to 5 task IDs per call; `detail: "full"` adds subtasks, comments, attachments, and history
- Per-item `status` rows — a partial batch returns the resolved tasks alongside typed errors for the rest

---

### `acme://projects/{projectId}` <sub>resource</sub>

- Project record as `application/json` — name, status, owners, open task count
- `projectId` comes from `acme_search_projects`

---

### `project_summary` <sub>prompt</sub>

- Arguments: `projectId` required; `includeClosed` (`"true"` / `"false"`) optional
- Returns two messages — an assistant framing message and a user message carrying the summary request
```

Link an examples file from an entry when one exists: `[View detailed examples](./examples/acme_search_projects.md)`.

### Features

The framework line below, verbatim — it names what a user gets from the framework (transports, auth, storage, observability), so it replaces any framework-feature bullets; contributor facts about code organization belong in the Development guide. Then two labeled bullet groups, both always present: `<Upstream>-specific:` (3–5 bullets on the server's own integration), then `Agent-friendly output:`.

```markdown
## Features

Built on [`@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-core): stdio and Streamable HTTP transports, pluggable auth (`none` / `jwt` / `oauth`), swappable storage (`in-memory`, `filesystem`, `Supabase`, `Cloudflare KV/R2/D1`), structured logging with optional OpenTelemetry tracing.

Acme-specific:

- Type-safe client for the Acme v2 API
- Automatic cleaning and simplification of API responses for agent consumption
- Workflow tools parallelize related sub-requests under a configurable concurrency limit

Agent-friendly output:

- Provenance on every response — source labels, effective-query echo, and confidence/coverage caveats so agents can reason about trust
- Graceful partial failure — batch tools return per-item success/error rows instead of failing the request, with structured status codes and actionable next-step text
- Discriminated output contracts — typed status and source fields let callers branch on data, not string parsing
```

The **Agent-friendly output** subsection documents output-design choices that make the server work well as an AI-agent backend. Always include it, with 2–4 bullets in the "Pattern — concrete detail" form, each naming fields or behavior verified in the server's source — not aspirational framework capabilities. Drop a pattern the server doesn't have (no batch tools → no partial-failure bullet) rather than claiming it. Examples of what fits:

- Provenance: source labels (`viaSource`, `source`), license/access-level fields, effective-query echo, best-effort warnings on lossy tiers
- Partial failure: per-item status in batch operations, structured error rows alongside successes, recovery hints ("Next Step" text)
- Discriminated outputs: union types on `source` or `status` fields, typed `unavailable` reasons, per-tier outcome traces (`triedTiers`)
- Response shaping: stripping upstream noise, normalizing inconsistent schemas, deduplicating nested structures

### Getting Started

Lead with the lowest-friction option. If a public hosted instance exists, show that first. Then the **three standard install configs in order — `bunx`, `npx`, `docker run`** — followed by the HTTP one-liner quickstart, then prerequisites and install steps.

**Standard three-block pattern** (the house style across shipping `@cyanheads/*` servers):

```markdown
## Getting started

Add the following to your MCP client configuration file. See [`docs/api-key.md`](./docs/api-key.md) for how to generate an API key.

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@cyanheads/my-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE": "stdio",
        "MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "ACME_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Or with npx (no Bun required):

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@cyanheads/my-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE": "stdio",
        "MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "ACME_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Or with Docker:

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=stdio",
        "-e", "ACME_API_KEY=your-api-key",
        "ghcr.io/cyanheads/my-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

For Streamable HTTP, set the transport and start the server:

\`\`\`sh
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_HTTP_PORT=3010 ACME_API_KEY=... bun run start:http
# Server listens at http://localhost:3010/mcp
\`\`\`
```

Refer to "your MCP client configuration file" generically — don't prescribe `claude_desktop_config.json` by name. Different clients use different config paths and the server isn't client-specific.

**If a public hosted instance exists**, precede the three-block pattern with a `### Public Hosted Instance` subsection and wrap the local configs in a `### Self-Hosted / Local` subsection:

```markdown
### Public Hosted Instance

A public instance is available at `https://my-server.example.com/mcp` — no installation required. Point any MCP client at it via Streamable HTTP:

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://my-server.example.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Self-Hosted / Local

[bunx / npx / docker blocks here]
```

**Prerequisites:** Include a Bun version line and any domain-specific setup (API key format, rate-limit tiers, required accounts). Don't just list Bun — readers need to know what else to prepare.

```markdown
### Prerequisites

- [Bun v1.4.0](https://bun.sh/) or higher (or Node.js v24+).
- An Acme API key — see [`docs/api-key.md`](./docs/api-key.md) for how to generate one.
```

**Installation:** Standard four steps (clone, cd, install, configure env):

```markdown
### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

\`\`\`sh
git clone https://github.com/cyanheads/my-mcp-server.git
\`\`\`

2. **Navigate into the directory:**

\`\`\`sh
cd my-mcp-server
\`\`\`

3. **Install dependencies:**

\`\`\`sh
bun install
\`\`\`

4. **Configure environment:**

\`\`\`sh
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set required vars
\`\`\`
```

Omit the clone/install steps if the server is npm-only (not meant to be cloned).

### Configuration

Table of environment variables. Include framework vars only if the server uses non-default values. Mark required vars with bold **Required.** in the description rather than a separate column. **Close with a pointer to `.env.example`** for the full list of optional overrides.

```markdown
## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `ACME_API_KEY` | **Required.** API key for the Acme service. | — |
| `ACME_BASE_URL` | API base URL. | `https://api.acme.com` |
| `ACME_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds. | `60000` |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE` | Transport: `stdio` or `http`. | `stdio` |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | Port for HTTP server. | `3010` |
| `MCP_AUTH_MODE` | Auth mode: `none`, `jwt`, or `oauth`. | `none` |
| `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level (RFC 5424). | `info` |
| `LOGS_DIR` | Directory for log files (Node.js only). | `<project-root>/logs` |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER_TYPE` | Storage backend. | `in-memory` |
| `OTEL_ENABLED` | Enable [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/tree/main/docs/telemetry) (spans, metrics, completion logs). | `false` |

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full list of optional overrides.
```

Source from the server config Zod schema and `.env.example`.

### Running the Server

Separate from Getting Started. Show dev, build + run, and Workers/Docker deployment if applicable.

```markdown
## Running the server

### Local development

- **Build and run:**

  \`\`\`sh
  # One-time build
  bun run rebuild

  # Run the built server
  bun run start:stdio
  # or
  bun run start:http
  \`\`\`

- **Run checks and tests:**

  \`\`\`sh
  bun run devcheck   # Lint, format, typecheck, security
  bun run test       # Vitest test suite
  bun run lint:mcp   # Validate MCP definitions against spec
  \`\`\`

### Docker

\`\`\`sh
docker build -t my-mcp-server .
docker run --rm -e ACME_API_KEY=your-key -p 3010:3010 my-mcp-server
\`\`\`

The Dockerfile defaults to HTTP transport, stateless session mode, and logs to `/var/log/my-mcp-server`. OpenTelemetry peer dependencies are installed by default — build with `--build-arg OTEL_ENABLED=false` to omit them.

### Cloudflare Workers

1. **Run locally under wrangler:**

\`\`\`sh
bun run deploy:dev
\`\`\`

2. **Deploy:**

\`\`\`sh
bun run deploy:prod
\`\`\`
```

Include the Docker subsection only if the server ships a Dockerfile, and the Workers subsection only if it ships a `src/worker.ts` entry. The Docker trailing paragraph (log directory, OTEL build arg) is important — it documents Dockerfile behavior that isn't obvious from the build command.

### Project Structure

Directory/purpose table orienting contributors to the codebase.

```markdown
## Project structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| `src/index.ts` | `createApp()` entry point — registers tools/resources/prompts and inits services. |
| `src/config` | Server-specific environment variable parsing and validation with Zod. |
| `src/mcp-server/tools` | Tool definitions (`*.tool.ts`). |
| `src/mcp-server/resources` | Resource definitions (`*.resource.ts`). |
| `src/mcp-server/prompts` | Prompt definitions (`*.prompt.ts`). |
| `src/services` | Domain service integrations. |
| `tests/` | Unit and integration tests mirroring `src/`. |
```

### Development Guide

Brief — link to CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for full details. State 3-4 key rules. **Include the "validate → normalize → never fabricate" bullet** — it's the canonical anti-hallucination convention for external API wrappers and reinforces the framework's `no fabricated signal` principle.

```markdown
## Development guide

See [`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for development guidelines and architectural rules. The short version:

- Handlers throw, framework catches — no `try/catch` in tool logic
- Use `ctx.log` for request-scoped logging, `ctx.state` for tenant-scoped storage
- Register new tools and resources via the barrels in `src/mcp-server/*/definitions/index.ts`
- Wrap external API calls: validate raw → normalize to domain type → return output schema; never fabricate missing fields
```

### Contributing

Issues only. Never write "pull requests are welcome" or any PR invitation — contributions arrive as issues, and `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` says the same.

```markdown
## Contributing

Issues are welcome. Run checks and tests before submitting:

\`\`\`sh
bun run devcheck
bun run test
\`\`\`
```

### License

One line referencing the LICENSE file.

```markdown
## License

Apache-2.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
```

## Principles

- **Gold standard first.** The `pubmed-mcp-server` README is the reference implementation; where it and this file disagree, the README wins.
- **Accuracy over aspiration.** Only document what exists. Don't describe planned features as if they're implemented.
- **Surface first.** The primitives are the most important content. The Overview leads with them.
- **Tables over prose** for structured data (tools, config, directories). Scannable and diff-friendly.
- **Overview + reference.** Overview tables for scanning; a Capability reference entry for every primitive, none skipped, with contract-shaped bullets rather than release-note narration.
- **Concise on every pass.** Re-runs tighten as well as correct; see § *Concision* for what survives a cut and what doesn't, and validate everything that survives.
- **One two-column table per primitive type.** Tools, resources, and prompts each get a small heading and a Name/Description table, even when a table has one row. No `Type` column — most servers are tool-heavy and many have no resources or prompts.
- **Promote hosted instances.** If there's a public URL, put it in a top-level callout under the badges — not buried in Getting Started.
- **Three install configs.** `bunx`, `npx`, `docker run` in that order. Each as a complete MCP-client JSON block.
- **Real names from code.** Tool names, env vars, and URIs must match the source exactly. Copy from the definitions, don't paraphrase.
- **Lowest friction first.** Hosted instance > bunx > npx > docker > clone.
- **No badges unless publishing.** Badges for unpublished packages are noise.
- **Client-agnostic framing.** Say "your MCP client configuration file", not `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- **Keep it current.** Update the README whenever tools are added or removed.
